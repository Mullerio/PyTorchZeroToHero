    "##### Introduction to Torchscript\n",
    "\n",
    "Torchscript helps you to save your models in a way that will greatly improve its inference perfomance and aditionally allow you to encorporate your models into production code in C++ designed for fast inference. Inference using Torchscript is especially powerful when using a GPU, as we will see. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially relevant in practice, a good video on the topic is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St3gdHJzic0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that torchscript is currently no longer in development, a similar feature meant to be its successor is in active development. See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html and  https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/export.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example, we are going to load the preloaded model restnet50 from `torchvision` which is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385 and look how fast its inference is on images. "
