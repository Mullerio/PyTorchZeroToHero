Originally this started as an introduction to PyTorch for my Students, due to high interest, I plan to implement some more basic PyTorch things for the ones interested. Very open to questions, ideas on what to cover and corrections on the mistakes I have definitely made :) 
 

Current todos: Introduction to ONNX, maybe some introduction to quantization, ResNet, DeepQLearning, GANs
